    After an initial meeting, the management team has decided they want to collect the following information. As a test case, you have your friend Jake complete the survey. Using JavaScript objects, create an object labeled customer and add the following key: value pairs:

    keys 	values
    firstName 	"jake"
    lastName 	"smith"
    email 	"jaekSmih!aol.com"
    phone 	undefined
    zipCode 	"631"
    favoriteFlavors 	32
    cupSize 	"medium"
    favoriteStore 	"Target"
    firstVisit 	false

    Jake made some mistakes when filling out the survey. So we talk to Jake and gather the correct information. Modify the following properties in the customer object using bracket notation: 
        email to "Jak3Smith1992@email.com"
        phone to 3195551234
        zipCode to "63132"
        favoriteFlavors to "coffee", "strawberry", and "matcha"

    As you review the survey draft with the management team, they have decided to remove a couple of items from the survey. Delete the following properties in the customer object using the delete keyword.

    zipCode
    favoriteStore

    The management team also wants to add the following items to the survey: toppings, future flavors, and today's purchase cost. You check with Jake, and he provides the other bits of information you need to add these keys. Add the following key:values to the customer object using dot notation:

    toppings: "chocolate sprinkles", "wafer straws", and "gummy bears"
    futureFlavors: "mango"
    todaysPurchaseCost: 5.32

    Before you finalize the survey, you decide to check your survey one last time. In an array, print the keys in your survey. You should have the following:

    firstName
    lastName
    email
    phone
    favoriteFlavors
    cupSize
    firstVisit
    toppings
    futureFlavors
    todaysPurchaseCost


* my goal with this project is to practice arrays and objects while also pushing all the actions to my github , to get comfortable with posting my professional portfolio .
